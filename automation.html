        Something I have been exposed to at work, which has encouraged me to implement in my daily life more is
        automation.
        I love having a routine, but there's only so much I can fit into my day so automating some stuff has been fun
        and useful.

                <p class="whiteText">
                    Ansible has fast become the favourite part of my job, allowing me to approach all sorts of
                    automation tasks with my Software Development background, whilst still exposing me to
                    technologies I never got to work with at university. Most tasks included AD management
                    using PowerShell, or Azure configuration using the Microsoft Graph API and really pushed
                    me to learn to think about coding in a different way then I usually worked.

                <h2>SPOTIFY 'RECENTLY LIKED' PLAYLIST</h2>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    I tend to just 'like' songs on Spotify, so they are added to my 'Liked Songs' playlist. However, as
                    like most people, I want to listen to my most recently liked songs without listening to them in the
                    same order every time, nor do I want to shuffle my entire 'Liked Songs' playlist. This led me to
                    developing a quick script which updates a smaller 'Recently Liked' playlist with my 30 most recently
                    liked songs.

                <p class="whiteText">
                    In an effort to take control of my spending, I aimed to track where and how much of my income I was
                    spending. I wanted to capture my spending trends each month to determine how much I could save
                    after spending the rest on living. The data would be updated in a Google Sheet each month.
