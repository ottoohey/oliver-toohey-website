    <h1>/ABOUT-ME</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Born in Melbourne, Australia, I was privileged enough to have a great life as a kid which set me up well as
            a young adult. Having done stints overseas a couple of times, I have been fortunate enough to experience
            living differently and adapting quickly to my environment.

                            Although I didn't pick up IT until my third year of studies, I immediately felt as if it was
                            the correct area for me. I loved the combination of technical and soft skills, which were
                            necessary for my major, Software Development. I found programming initially challenging,
                            however extremely rewarding and enjoy working full stack.

                            my Human Rights major, it opened up more opportunities socially and professionally
