        Born in Melbourne, Australia, I was privileged enough to have a great life as a kid which set me up well as
        a young adult.
        Having done stints overseas a couple of times, I have been fortunate enough to experience living differently
        and adapting quickly to my environment.

                        Although I didn't pick up IT until my third year of studies, I immediately felt as if it was
                        the correct area for me. I loved the combination of technical and soft skills, which were
                        necessary for my major, Software Development. I found programming initially challenging,
                        however extremely rewarding and enjoy working full stack.

                <h2>BACHELOR OF ARTS</h2>

                        Like a lot of fresh high school graduates, I did not know what to study at university,
                        so I went into Arts. Whilst it never became my passion and I'm not sure I'll ever use
                        my Human Rights major, it opened up more opportunities socially and professionally
                        than I could have imagined. It allowed me to be a committee member of the Arts Society
                        for three years and study on exchange at Tilburg University.
