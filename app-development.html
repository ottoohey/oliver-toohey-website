    <h1 class="yellowText">/APP-DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <p>
        Most of my app development has been done using Flutter. I really enjoyed how quick it was possible to
        develop with for any device.<br />
        So far, I have only released one app, Project Cut, however I have worked on others which I have not been
        able to release yet for various reasons.

            <p class="whiteText">
                At the beginning of 2021, I started working out after a lazy hiatus. It quickly became one of my
                favourite
                hobbies and I embraced the bulk/cut cycle. Upon getting sick of writing down on paper my progress, I
                decided
                to develop an app that not only let me
                track my progress, but provide calculated targets.

                During my time at university, I was a committee member of the Arts Society and as a result was heavily
            involved in organising events.
            I saw an opportunity to develop an app that acted as a hub for marketing, ticket sales and membership
            management for clubs on campus.
            Unfortunately, I never fully completed it, but it exposed me to some of the complexities of developing a
            complex app.
