            Most of my app development has been done using Flutter. I really enjoyed how quick it was possible to
            develop with for any device.<br />
            So far, I have only released one app, Project Cut, however I have worked on others which I have not been
            able to release yet for various reasons.

            At the beginning of 2021, I started working out after a lazy hiatus. It quickly became one of my favourite
            hobbies and I embraced the bulk/cut cycle. Upon getting sick of writing down on paper my progress, I decided
            to develop an app that not only let me
            track my progress, but provide calculated targets.

            During my time at university, I was a committee member of the Arts Society and as a result was heavily
            involved in organising events.
            I saw an opportunity to develop an app that acted as a hub for marketing, ticket sales and membership
            management for clubs on campus.
            Unfortunately, I never fully completed it, but it exposed me to some of the complexities of developing a
            complex app.
