        I was fortunate enough to become a Grad at John Holland at the start of 2021 for my first full time job.
        After rotating through two teams, I got to work with a bunch of cool technologies, most of which I had
        no idea existed throughout university. Whilst neither team practiced what I predominantly studied at uni,
        being Software Development, I learnt so much about other parts of the IT industry which has added to my
        skillset enormously.

                    Working in AWS has been a great experience and I have been well supported by extremely
                    knowledgable team who have been able to guide me across the platform. They also encouraged me
                    to get my AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certificate, which boosted my abilities tenfold.

                    Most of my day to day was mainly sysadmin work, where we were responsible for user management,
                    all devices, mailboxes, automation and our Azure systems.

                    My first rotation was in the Business Intelligence team, where I predominantly worked in
                    MS SQL Server and Power BI to cover all the data and reporting for the company. I relied heavily
                    on my interpersonal skills, as we often worked with users who knew what they wanted,
                    but didn't necessarily have the technical background to implement so working together was crucial.
