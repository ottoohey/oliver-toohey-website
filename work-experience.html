    <h1>/WORK-EXPERIENCE</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>
            I was fortunate enough to become a Grad at John Holland at the start of 2021 for my first full time job.
            After rotating through two teams, I got to work with a bunch of cool technologies, most of which I had
            no idea existed throughout university. Whilst neither team practiced what I predominantly studied at uni,
            being Software Development, I learnt so much about other parts of the IT industry which has added to my
            skillset enormously.

                <p class="whiteText">
                    Ansible has fast become the favourite part of my job, allowing me to approach all sorts of
                    automation tasks with my Software Development background, whilst still exposing me to
                    technologies I never got to work with at university. Most tasks included AD management
                    using PowerShell, or Azure configuration using the Microsoft Graph API and really pushed
                    me to learn to think about coding in a different way then I usually worked.

                    Most of my day to day was mainly sysadmin work, where we were responsible for user management,

                <h2>BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE</h2>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    My first rotation was in the Business Intelligence team, where I predominantly worked in
                    MS SQL Server and Power BI to cover all the data and reporting for the company. I relied heavily
                    on my interpersonal skills, as we often worked with users who knew what they wanted,
                    but didn't necessarily have the technical background to implement so working together was crucial.
